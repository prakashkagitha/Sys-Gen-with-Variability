## Systematic generalization emerges in Seq2Seq models with variability in data

Update (25/04/2020): Updated code used for each experiment in the paper so that one could train the models and replicate the results for themselves. Added .txt files for datasets used.

Initial commit (3/04/2020): generate_data() in scan_language.py can generate entire SCAN dataset (Lake & Baroni (2017)) and also different augmented versions of SCAN according to the parameters we could change. Data for the experiments adding synthetic primitives and which contains compound variables are generated from this.
