## Systematic generalization emerges in Seq2Seq models with variability in data

<<<<<<< HEAD
Initial commit (3/04/2020): generate_data() in scan_language.py than can generate an entire SCAN dataset (Lake & Baroni (2017) )and also different augmented versions of SCAN according to flexible parameters we could change. Data for the experiments adding synthetic primitives and which contains compound variables are generated from this.
=======
Initial commit (3/04/2020): 'scan_language.py' can generate SCAN dataset and different augmented versions of SCAN according to one's objectives. Data for the experiments adding synthetic primitives and which contains compound variables are generated from this.

Upcoming: configurations to create data used in each experiment.
