Initial commit (3/04/2020): 'scan_language.py' than can generate SCAN dataset and also different augmented versions of SCAN according to one's objectives. Data for the experiments adding synthetic primitives and which contains compound variables are generated from this.

Upcoming: configurations to create data used in each experiment.
